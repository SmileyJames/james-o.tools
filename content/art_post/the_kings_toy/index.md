The King chess piece is depicted with a cross at his head. The cross additionally features in "toy", forming an inverted symbol of Venus. Among the graffiti community, a "king" is a highly regarded graffiti artist and "toy" is a derogatory term. Painting the word "toy" over a graffiti piece is a mark of disrespect.
